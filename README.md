# Recombination-detection-pipeline-for-large-gene-families
This set of PERL scripts automates detection of recombination events in large gene families. 

This computation pipeline is reported in the following article:
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5020489/

It was tested with <br>
(1) <i>T. cruzi</i> trans-sialidase gene family (3209 genes with an average length of 1.5kb)<br>
(2) <i>T. cruzi</i> MASP gene family (1032 genes) <br>
(3) <i>T. cruzi</i> Mucin gene family (661 genes)

PERL script #1,#3,#4,#6 runs in Linux , and  #2,#5 runs in window environment

This set of PERL scripts is in active development. Please direct any questions to github.com/duopeng
