# Recombination-detection-pipeline-for-large-gene-families
This set of PERL scripts automates detection of recombination events in large gene families. 

It was tested with <br>
(1)T. cruzi trans-sialidase gene family (3209 genes with an average length of 1.5kb)<br>
(2) T. cruzi MASP gene family (1032 genes) <br>
(3) T. cruzi Mucin gene family (661 genes)

PERL script #1,#3,#4,#6 runs in Linux , and  #2,#5 runs in window environment

This set of PERL scripts is in active development. Please direct any questions to github.com/duopeng
